    <h2>Twelve Pillars Review</h2>

    <h3>Review of Chapters 4-7</h3>
    <p>
        The main focus of chapters 4-7 is Michael's quest for personal development and the lessons Charlie 
        teaches him about time management, goal-setting, surrounding oneself with the proper people, and 
        the value of lifelong learning.</br> </br>
        <i>Chapter 4 - Achieve Your Goals</i></br>
        Charlie highlights the value of goal-setting as a transforming process that aids people in achieving 
        particular aims and advances their personal growth throughout their talks. He exhorts Michael to put 
        his goals down in writing, stating that doing so makes them more concrete and involves the mind in the 
        process of achieving them. </br> </br>
        With that lesson in mind, I intend to list my professional and personal ambitions, dividing them into 
        short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals. This will support my goal-imaging and help me focus on my top goals.
        </br> </br>
        <i>Chapter 5 - The Proper Use of Time</i></br>
        The ability to manage time and distinguish between critical and urgent jobs is another crucial element. 
        Charlie expresses the idea that opportunities arise every day and that the most effective use of one's time should 
        be based on one's overall life goals. I will apply this by analyzing how my time is spent daily, making a conscious 
        effort to try to spend sufficient time on things that will contribute to my long-term goals.
        </br> </br>
        <i>Chapter 6 - Surround Yourself With the Best People</i></br>
        The impact of associations and relationships on personal success is also covered in the text. Charlie suggests that 
        negative connections might impede progress and advises Michael to reflect on his friendships and the influences in 
        his environment. He continues to say that successful people frequently surround themselves with other ambitious and 
        positive individuals, which creates an atmosphere that is favorable for achievement. I will take heed to the advice 
        given by Charlie and evaluate my current relationships so that I won't be surrounded by persons who will hinder my success.
        </br> </br>
        <i>Chapter 7 - Be a Life-Long Learner</i></br>
        The significance of lifelong learning is the final thing addresses. Charlie urges Michael to read more and draw from other 
        people's experiences since he believes that self-education is essential for success. This acts as a reminder that education 
        is a lifelong process that doesn't end with formal schooling. To foster a mindset of lifelong learning, I will commit to 
        reading regularly, starting with the book recommended by Charlie, "The Magic of Thinking Big." This will not only expand my 
        knowledge but also provide new perspectives that can help in my personal and professional life.
